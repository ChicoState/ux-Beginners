She also tries to find new methods and activities that could possibly help her patients.

## Persona: Gabriel

Gabriel is a 32-year-old stock broker in New York City. He enjoys competition and likes to get ahead of his colleagues when it comes to trading stocks and making clients happy. Gabriel seems to do really well at his job, so he has a lot of free time, but he doesn’t like to spend that time doing something that isn’t productive.

# Scenarios

## Scenario: Performance at the Party (Jayce)

Jayce is at a party and he wants to show off his skills with the piano that is at the venue. He recently worked on a piece with the course that he was taking. At this point he wants to be able to access the sheet music and the background music as well. His phone still works and he want to access it quickly without delay.

## Katherine's Scenario

Katherine’s youngest child has just been sent to college and has realized she has a lot more free time on her hands. She asked her husband what he will do with his free time and he responds with “I want to relax a little at first, maybe travel, but I want to get back into golf since I haven’t played since college. What will you do?” She never gave it much thought since the last time she had this much free time was before her children, where she took care of flowers for her mother. She’s been meaning to see her mother but has never had the time to go to Germany.

## Scenario: Getting an Edge Over His Colleagues (Gabriel)

Given his competitive nature, Gabriel wants to learn something new that could give him an advantage in trading stocks. He thinks that giving himself a refresher on statistics and maybe learning advanced statistics could help him do this, and given his free time, he’s willing to put in as much time as he needs. Since he’s on the go so much, he wants a platform that will allow him to do this pretty much anywhere. Because NYC can be such a loud and hectic place, he prefers to watch videos with his headphones over reading text so he could be more concentrated.
