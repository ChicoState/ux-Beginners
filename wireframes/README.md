</p>

The home page is the first page that users are greeted with. They can search for a guide by using the search bar, or they can create their own guide by pressing the button in the bottom-right corner. In addition, recently seen guides will be displayed to a user in the home page.

</p>

The results page is shown to the user after a search query is performed. It includes filters on the left-hand side of the screen so that users can find the exact guide they are looking for. The search bar is still present at the top of the page in case the user does not like the results that are shown. This frame also contains placeholders where the thumbnails of the guides will be displayed.

</p>

Once a user clicks on a guide that catches their eye, the content page will display the title of the guide and a description of the guide that contains information such as prerequisites, topics, etc. There is a placeholder in the middle of the frame that illustrates the location of where the video player will be displayed in the page. If there are multiple parts to a guide, they will appear on the left-hand side of the page for the user to continue learning from.

</p>

If a user wants to create their own guide, they will click the button on the bottom-right of the home page to bring up a prompt where they can fill out the fields and upload a video for it. The guide will then appear in the results page when searching for it after it has been created.

This frame shows what happens when a search query can not be resolved. It will tell the user to try searching again. This occurs when there is no guide related to what a user has searched.
