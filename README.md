# Beginners

Beginners is a website designed for users who need guides and tutorials for any occasion. It will provide a variety of tutorials from supplementary courses, such as math and English, to hobbies/pastimes, such as playing an instrument and cooking. There will also be different levels of difficulty for these guides depending on the users preference, from beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Users will also be able to upload their own guides as well so that their knowledge can be received by those with similar passions.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

For the second sprint of the Beginners project (Tutorial website), we created wireframes and demonstrated a prototype, which in turn gave us feedback for improvements for the application and improved fidelity (better representation of the final product). 

**Informal Feedback**
- Need for better filtering system
- Suggestion for a review system to enhance quality

**Cognitive Feedback**
- Insights from UX researchers on wireframes
- Focus on improving user experience

**Setback**
- Feedback not aligned with target audience (general public)
- Need for more targeted user research
