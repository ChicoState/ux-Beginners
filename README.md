# Beginners

Beginners is a website designed for users who need guides and tutorials for any occasion. It will provide a variety of tutorials from supplementary courses, such as math and English, to hobbies/pastimes, such as playing an instrument and cooking. There will also be different levels of difficulty for these guides depending on the users preference, from beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Users will also be able to upload their own guides as well so that their knowledge can be received by those with similar passions.
