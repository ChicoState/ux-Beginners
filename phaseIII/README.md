# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

After designing the interface of the application through our wireframes, we needed to develop high-fidelity prototypes to conduct usability testing and evaluate the interface's interaction design. The interface needed to be capable of someone navigating it, allowing us to observe how potential users would use it. A prototype was created in Figma based on the wireframes so that we could conduct the user tests and gather the data needed to further improve our product design.

## Methods

The start of the user testing process involved us creating a usability protocol for us to follow when conducting the user tests, as well as creating IRB and informed consent forms to ensure that we’re following ethical guidelines. After reading the introduction to the participants, we asked them five questions to gather background information about them and their mental models of learning services:
  1. What learning services do you use?
  2. Do you prefer reading something or watching something when learning?
  3. What are your favorite features of them?
  4. How do these services help you learn efficiently?
  5. What things could be improved with these services?

  We asked these questions to get an idea of who our competitors are and why our participants enjoy using those services, so that we can get an idea of how to improve our application from a usability point of view. After we asked the background questions, we moved onto the tasks for the participants to do. We recorded whether or not a task was done successfully by the participant and asked how they would rate it on a scale of one to five with one being “very difficult” and five being “very easy” for each of the tasks we had the participants partake in. The participants worked through three tasks:
  1. Your current iPhone is very old and is starting to fail, so you decide it is now time to upgrade to a newer model. You want to pick a model that isn't too expensive but is still in-style. Try to search up a video that compares different iPhone models.
  2. It's your mom's birthday and you wanted to make it special by cooking some barbeque for her. However, you have no knowledge on grilling. Try looking up videos about grilling.
  3. You are a tutor for a Usability Engineering course who wants to make educational content for your peers. Try creating a new guide that explains the 3 most important aspects of UX.

Finally, we asked the participants some questions during a debrief regarding the design of the prototype. We asked these questions to gather constructive criticism of our prototype. We asked four questions during the debrief:
  1. What did you like best?
  2. What could be improved?
  3. Does the organization of courses/videos/other affiliated course material make sense?
  4. What other features would you like?

Our overall approach to the study was to focus on gathering formative data to get feedback on the features available in our prototype, the layout of the design of the prototype, and how it felt to use. The only data we collected that can be considered summative were our decisions regarding the participants being able to finish their tasks or not. A think-alout protocol was not enforced as we thought that it could be too distracting for the participant when they were trying to complete their tasks. And as mentioned before, we recorded their ratings for each task to measure the difficulty the participants experienced.

## Findings

This study revealed that the current design is sufficient for the project. Nearly all of the tasks were completed by the test users. The following were outstanding details for the users:
- **Task 1:** The design was straightforward, but the users did want to interact with the images and the tags.
- **Task 2:** The pictures were helpful for navgation, but using the logo rather than a back button was not intuative.
- **Task 3:** Recommendations were to reconsider the fuctionality of the Upload Button and options for including chapter during upload

## Conclusions

This test revealed valuable insights into both the strengths and areas for improvement of the design. Participants provided feedback across multiple facets, including ease of use, task completion, interface organization, and desired features. These features include:
  1. Simplicity: Overall, participants found the interface simple and easy to navigate, and they rated the tasks as either “very easy” or “easy,” with minimal obstacles in completing the tasks.
  2. Search: The search functionality worked as expected for most users, with many commenting positively on its simplicity and effectiveness.
  3. Organization: The organization of content seemed logical and navigable. The layout has similarities to other educational platforms, making the prototype easier to understand.

There were a couple of areas that did need improvement, such as:
  1. Interactivity Issues: A significant amount of feedback centered around the lack of interactivity with visual elements. Images (such as video thumbnails) and features like the "Recently Seen" section were not functional and accessing/selecting certain features, like the filters, detract from the overall experience.
  2. Navigation Confusion: While the overall design was simple, there were instances where users got stuck, especially when trying to navigate through more complex tasks like creating a new guide.

We were also given recommendations of new features we can as:
  1. Personalization: Features such as a favorites list, a record of completed courses, and personalized content recommendations, allow users to feel more in control of their learning experience and ensure that content recommendations align with their preferences.
  2. Content Structure: Adding clearer content navigation, such as adding chapters or progress indicators for guides, allows track progression and a better understanding of how to move through the material in a more organized manner.
  3. Button/Feature Clarity: Users have asked to make similar buttons distinguishable (like the "Upload Video" and "Create Guide" buttons) and make certain functions, such as the back button and "Exit" buttons, more visible and intuitive.

## Caveats

All of the participants are college students in a Usability Engineering course. This means that they are most likely more proficient in their ability to use a computer. Additionally, the program that was used for the demonstration did not allow users to input text. Since our product uses that information to do a search we were not able to see if our users are able to navigate the search fuctionallity of the product.
