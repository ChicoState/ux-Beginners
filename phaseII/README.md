# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

For the second phase, the UX team gathered informal feedback and had cognitive walkthroughs conducted on the wireframes for the application.

The UX team gave the SE team questions to ask during their MVP presentations to gather informal feedback. The questions that were asked are "Do the filters work as intended?", "Are the recommended results good enough?", and "What else do you want to see from this project?". The sample size is the class of 65 students (n = 65) who are taking the CSCI 430 course.

Three external evalutors (n = 3) conducted the cognitive walkthroughs for our wireframes that showcased the current design of the project. Specifically, the external evaluators are UX students who are not related to our project, and they did this during the "x11 Cognitive Walkthroughs" assignment. Each of the evaluators focused on the "Jayce" persona and the corresponding scenario called "Performance at the Party" during the cognitive walkthrough. The external evaluators conducted a specific style of cognitive walkthrough called the "two-question streamlined approach of [Spencer (2000)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/user-interface-inspection/9780124103917/xhtml/BIB001.html#FUR85)" where they answered two questions per frame: "Will the user know what to do at this step?" and "If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?"

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

The main takeaways from the findings are the filtering system not being sophisticated enough for users to find exactly what they are looking for, having no way of verifying that the learning material is legitimate, and users having trouble determining if they are using the application correctly.

The results recommend that we do the following revisions:
1. Add user stories to determine more filters that users would like to apply on content and to find a way for users to contact teachers for extra help.
2. Make a persona and scenario for a teacher who wants to upload educational content and wants some sort of credibility check to ensure that users know their content is legitimate.
3. Improvement in displaying content to a user when they use the search functionality and picking a result to show they are using the application correctly in our wireframes.

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
